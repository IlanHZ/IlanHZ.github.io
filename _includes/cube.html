            Passionate about innovation and technology, Iâ€™ve been studying Business Administration in Belgium, before immersing myself in the General Assembly Web Development program.</br></br>
            Coding, which was new to me at the time, allowed me to gain great problem solving skills and to develop my creativity, while becoming a real passion.</br></br>
            Combining the technical skills I have learned and my interest for business and entrepreneurship, I am now looking to join a team where I could continue to learn web development while being involved in the business process.</br></br>
