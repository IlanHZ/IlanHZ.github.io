description: 'For this project, we were a team of three. We decided to develop an app related to the current migrant crisis.
We created a platform with two principal functionalities. First, it allows visitors on the website to donate money to a specific refugee, through the Stripe API. Second, it enables potential hosts to connect with refugees in order to house them for the amount of time where the government havenâ€™t given them a proper housing solution. 
This app was developed in JavaScript and Ajax, using NodeJS. Moreover, we use the Google Maps API to create a map showing the origin country of each refugee and the Guardian API to have a live feed of news related to the migrant crisis. I especially focused on the Google Map API. 
This project have been the occasion to develop great teamwork skills and to approach a current disaster using a technological scope.'
