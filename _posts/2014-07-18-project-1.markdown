description: 'The idea of this app came from a simple social observation combined with a will of creating something that would impact the society in a positive way. Therefore, I choose to develop an app that would help seniors benefit from all the advantages of cohabitation in order to find a solution to loneliness and expensive rent.
This app was developed in Ruby, using Sinatra. The users can post their property, that they can view on a map (thanks to the Google Maps API) and get in touch with each other through an internal messaging system. 
This project was the first time I created a fully functional app, developing crucial skills in back-end as much as in front-end.'
